# Function App

This template provisions a function app on a Consumption plan, which is a dynamic hosting plan. The app runs on demand and you're billed per execution, with no standing resource committment.

## About Azure Functions

Develop more efficiently with Functions, an event-driven serverless compute platform that can also solve complex orchestration problems. Build and debug locally without additional setup, deploy and operate at scale in the cloud, and integrate services using triggers and bindings.

### Simplify complex orchestration challenges resolution

Serverless functions are meant to be short-lived and statelessâ€”until you need them to solve stateful problems. Remove this limitation in a fully managed way without provisioning more resources, just by coding your workflow definition. Simplify complex, stateful coordination requirements programmatically in event-driven applications with the Durable Functions extension. Use your functions also on declarative workflows that can take advantage of over 250 connectors with Azure Logic Apps.

### Connect other services without hard-coding integrations for faster solutions development

Write only the code that truly matters to your business. Save coding time with a programming model based on triggers and bindings that enable your serverless applications to respond to events and connect to other services seamlessly. Build more scalable and stable event-driven applications with a microservices-friendly approach using Functions.
